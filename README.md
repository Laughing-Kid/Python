# AutoFeedback

Due to the long and uninteresting feedback set by our university two programmers from PIEAS university decided to step up. We decided to build an auto feedback program which is very user friendly. You can interact with it through minimalist GUI and it does the work in a matter of seconds which previously took half an hour!

## Requirements

* A potato PC
* 64-bit & 32-bit Windows
* Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome (Latest)

## Additional Notes

The program can take upto 2 minutes to fully load depending upon your connection speed. This is due to downloading of webdriver if one doesn't exists in your computer already.
